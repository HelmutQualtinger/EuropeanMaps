# EuropeanMaps

This project contains maps of Europe.

## SchweizMap.py

This script generates a map of Switzerland, highlighting its cantons. It uses the `matplotlib` library to create the map and adds labels for each canton. The script reads geographical data from a shapefile to draw the boundaries of the cantons.
